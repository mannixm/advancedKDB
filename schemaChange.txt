Discuss the effect a schema change to the trade table in the above system e.g. a sequence number column was added to both trade and quote tables.

Current feedhandler would keep insert data with a missing column unless updated

How you would plan a turnover to update the schema.

Wait until the end of day and ensure all the data has been saved down to the HDB
Use the addcol function of dbmaint.q
Backup the sym file
Add the column to the trade and quote table using the addcol function of dbmaint.qChange the .d file as necessary to reflect the new column and/or new order
You may wish to go back and add in nulls to the previous data for the new column, (I'm not sure of dbmaint does this)
